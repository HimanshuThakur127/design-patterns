The main benefits we get from design patterns are the following:

1. They are proven solutions: Because design patterns are often used by many developers, you can be certain that they work. And not only that, you can be certain that they were revised multiple times and optimizations were probably implemented.
2. They are easily reusable: Design patterns document a reusable solution which can be modified to solve 3.multiple particular problems, as they are not tied to a specific problem.
3. They are expressive: Design patterns can explain a large solution quite elegantly.
4. They ease communication: When developers are familiar with design patterns, they can more easily communicate with one another about potential solutions to a given problem.
5. They prevent the need for refactoring code: If an application is written with design patterns in mind, it is often the case that you wonâ€™t need to refactor the code later on because applying the correct design pattern to a given problem is already an optimal solution.
6. They lower the size of the codebase: Because design patterns are usually elegant and optimal solutions, they usually require less code than other solutions.
